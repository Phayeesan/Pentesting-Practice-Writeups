we start with our nmap scan
nmap -A -T4 -p- -v --min-rate=1000 10.10.193.246
two port opened
ports 49663 which seems like an http port
ports 49667

lets start our enum from 49667
navigating to the wbpage look like a microsoft iis page, lets view source
didnt find anything in the source or the image downloaded

let's try directory bruteforce
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.87.118:49663 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster

found a directory but seems empty
http://10.10.87.118:49663/aspnet_client/
maybe we should bruteforce it again

http://10.10.87.118:49663/aspnet_client/system_web/4_0_30319/.

so i tried everything i could but nothing is working, checkd one of the walkthroughs an found that a threader3000 port scanner was used, lets do our port scan again using threader3000
to install
git clone https://github.com/dievus/threader3000.git
make file excutable
chmod +x file.py
start file
/.file.py

we found 5 opn ports, smb and http protocols
Port 135 is open
Port 80 is open
Port 139 is open
Port 445 is open
Port 3389 is open

run nmap script and version scan on the found open ports
nmap -p135,80,139,445,3389,49667,49663,49669 -sV -sC -T4 -Pn -oA 10.10.87.118

found port 80 running microsoft iis 10
port 445 smb running windows server 2016
 now lets enum smb

found a shar on the smb wich contains a pasword.txt
now lets gt this pass
found 2 base64 encoded texts, lets decode it
echo "Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==" | base64 -d

found a uer and a pass after decoding the first
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123

lets do it for the second
