ROOT ME THM
nmap scan first
sudo nmap -A 10.10.160.87 -p- --min-rate -T4 1000 -v -oN nmap.txt
found 2 ports
port 22
port 80

lets navigate to the web server on port 80
nothing intersting on the webpage or source code

lets fuzz for directories
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.26.171:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster

found a directory
/panel

navigating to the directory and we found a file upload functionality
lets see if i can upload a file and get a revere shell
finally got a reverse shell with .phtml file extension even though other etensions were allowed except .php

took m a while before i could find the flag
finally found it at /var/www folder


now let's xcalate privilege
earch for suid files
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

which python
/usr/bin/python

searching through gtfobins for python PE

going through gtfobins, i found this payload

python -c 'print(open("root/root.txt").read())'

It reads data from files, it may be used to do privileged reads or disclose files outside a restricted file system.

now let's try to use this payload to read our root flag
finally got the flag
