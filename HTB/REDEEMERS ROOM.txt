Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source advanced NoSQL key-value data store used as a
database, cache, and message broker. The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is
typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives
to provide consistency

Installing redis-cli
Now, to be able to interact remotely with the Redis server, we need to download the redis-cli utility. It
can be downloaded using the following command :

sudo apt install redis-tools


Alternatively, we can also connect to the Redis server using the netcat utility, but we will be using redis-
cli in this write-up as it is more convenient to use.

connect to target using
redis-cli -h target_ip

Upon a successful connection with the Redis server, we should be able to see a prompt in the terminal
One of the basic Redis enumeration commands is info which returns information and statistics about the Redis server.

The keyspace section provides statistics on the main dictionary of each database. The statistics include the
number of keys, and the number of keys with an expiration.
In our case, under the Keyspace section, we can see that only one database exists with index 0 .
Let us select this Redis logical database by using the select command followed by the index number of
the database that needs to be selected

furthermore, we can list all the keys present in the database using the command : keys *


Finally, we can view the values stored for a corresponding key using the get command followed by the keynote
